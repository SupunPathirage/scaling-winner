        These fish inhabit South American rivers, floodplains, lakes and reservoirs.
         Although often described as extremely predatory and mainly feeding on fish, their dietary habits vary extensively, 
      and they will also take plant material & leading to their classification as omnivorous.

      In this family of fish, the head is bony and the elongated body
       is covered by large, heavy scales, with a mosaic pattern of canals. The dorsal and anal fins have soft rays and are long based,
        while the pectoral and ventral fins are small. The name "bonytongues" is derived from a toothed bone on the floor of the mouth.

      The oscar is a species of fish from the cichlid family known under a variety of common names, 
      including tiger oscar, velvet cichlid, and marble cichlid. In tropical South America, where the species naturally resides,
       A. ocellatus specimens are often found for sale as a food fish in the local markets.Oscar fish are omnivores.Oscars will often lay claim to an area of the aquarium and will be very aggressive towards other fish encroaching on their newly established territory inside the aquarium or lake. The size of the territory varies depending on the size and aggressiveness of the fish, and its surroundings. Once the oscar establishes a territory,
        it will vigorously defend it by chasing away other fish.[

Other species of betta are more rare. The males often express their aggression at other males as well as females by flaring at one another. They are surface breathers, and breathe air from the surface to make bubble nest which attracts the female for breeding. Betta fishes are found in little water bodies,
             full of fallen leaf litter and peat thereby providing lots of hiding places.</p>

          <p class="description">Tetra is the common name of many small freshwater characiform fishes. Tetras come from Africa, Central America, and South America, belonging to the biological family Characidae and to its former subfamilies Alestidae (the "African tetras") and Lebiasinidae. The Characidae are distinguished from other fish by the presence of a small adipose fin between the dorsal and caudal fins. Many of these, such as the neon tetra (Paracheirodon innesi), are brightly colored and easy to keep in captivity. 
            Consequently, they are extremely popular for home aquaria.</p>

The species is closely related to the marine common ling and the cusk. It is the only member of the genus Lota.
            For some time of the year, the burbot lives under ice, and it requires frigid temperatures to breed</p>

It is commonly kept as a pet in indoor aquariums, and is one of the most popular aquarium fish. Goldfish released into the wild have become an invasive pest in parts of North America.[4]
Native to East Asia, the goldfish is a relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the Prussian carp and the crucian carp). It was first selectively bred for color in imperial China more than 1,000 years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been developed. Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration, 
            and coloration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black are known).</p>

They are highly adaptable and thrive in many different environmental and ecological conditions.
            [5] Male guppies, which are smaller than females, have ornamental caudal and dorsal fins.</p>

            This body shape allows them to hide among roots and plants, often on a vertical surface. </p>

It is the largest species in the gar family, and among the largest freshwater fish in North America. The fossil record traces its group's existence back to the Early Cretaceous over 100 million years ago. Gars are often referred to as "primitive fishes", or "living fossils" because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors, such as a spiral valve intestine, 
            which is also common to the digestive system of sharks, and the ability to breathe both air and water.</p>
